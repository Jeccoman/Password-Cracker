## Phase 1(Done): Offline Cracking Basics  
1. Basic Brute Force (Alphabets only, fixed length)  
2. Dictionary Attack (from file)  
3. Hash Comparison (MD5/SHA1/SHA256 using OpenSSL or own implementation)  

---

## Phase 2(On progress): Advanced Offline Cracking  
1. Hybrid Attack (Append/prepend numbers to words)  
2. Rainbow Table Lookup (build and search simple rainbow tables)  
3. Rule-based Attacks (basic rules like capitalization, 1337 speak)  

 **Add Hash Formats:** bcrypt, NTLM

## Phase 3(On progress): Online Cracking Engine  
1. Basic HTTP Login Brute Force (test dummy web server locally)  
2. Credential Stuffing with Proxy Support  
3. FTP/SSH Brute Force using libraries like libssh or raw sockets  
4. Password Spraying Logic  
5. Phishing Simulation with Key Capture
